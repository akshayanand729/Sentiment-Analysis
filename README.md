# Sentiment-Analysis
•	IMDB dataset having 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics.
  This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar   movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. So, predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning        algorithms.
